*Terminology you should know when learning HTML*

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 

<body>
  This holds all the content of your website that is displayed on the internet.

<header> 
  Header element is used to contain the content that appears at the top of 
  your website. This might be your navigation bar with a logo and links to navigate 
  your website. Header is the direct descendant of the <body> element.

<main>
  This element should be placed between the <header> and <footer> elements and will 
  contain the main content of your site. 

  <nav>
    Navigational menus are located both at the top, sidebar or footer of most websites.
    It is typical to see the <nav> element utilized within the header and signifies the sitewide 
    navigation of your website.

  <article>
    Customary in a blog post to wrap your blog post content within the <article> element. 

  <section>
    This element is used to identify content that is a sub-section of the main content. Think of 
    a book with chapters. You would use the <section> element to wrap every paragraph. 
      A good rule for when to use <section> and when to use <div>:
      <div> - use to wrap content that makes it easier to style the content or to make it easier 
        for JavaScript to utilize.
      <section> - when writing an outline of the document, any area that you would list the content
        use <section> element.

  <aside> 
    Content that is not apart of the main content. This will put the data to the side of the area that 
    you have the main content. 

  <address>
    contact information should be wrapped in the <address> element. 

  <footer>
    located on the bottom of your website document. Typically you will find the copyright and contact
    information.
